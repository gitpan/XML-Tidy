NAME
    XML::Tidy - tidy indenting of XML documents

VERSION
    This documentation refers to version 1.10.B52FpLx of XML::Tidy, which
    was released on Mon May 2 15:51:21:59 2011.

SYNOPSIS
      use XML::Tidy;

      # create new   XML::Tidy object from         MainFile.xml
      my $tidy_obj = XML::Tidy->new('filename' => 'MainFile.xml');

      # Tidy up the indenting
         $tidy_obj->tidy();

      # Write out changes back to MainFile.xml
         $tidy_obj->write();

DESCRIPTION
    This module creates XML document objects (with inheritance from
    XML::XPath) to tidy mixed-content (ie. non-data) text node indenting.
    There are also some other handy member functions to compress && expand
    your XML document object (into either a compact XML representation or a
    binary one).

2DU
    - maybe add support for binary char && short ints && single-precision
    floats
    - maybe store recurring patterns of node index sets in new array that
    can be indexed themself
    - fix reload() from messing up unicode escaped &XYZ; components like
    Copyright &#xA9; -> © && Registered &#xAE; -> ®
    - What else does Tidy need?

USAGE
  new()
    This is the standard Tidy object constructor. Except for the new
    'binary' option, it can take the same parameters as an XML::XPath object
    constructor to initialize the XML document object. These can be any one
    of:

      'filename' => 'SomeFile.xml'
      'binary'   => 'SomeBinaryFile.xtb'
      'xml'      => $variable_which_holds_a_bunch_of_XML_data
      'ioref'    => $file_InputOutput_reference
      'context'  => $existing_node_at_specified_context_to_become_new_obj

  reload()
    The reload() member function causes the latest data contained in a Tidy
    object to be re-parsed which re-indexes all nodes. This can be necessary
    after modifications have been made to nodes which impact the tree node
    hierarchy because XML::XPath's find() member preserves state info which
    can get out-of-sync. reload() is probably rarely useful by itself but it
    is needed by strip() && prune() so it is exposed as a method in case it
    comes in handy for other uses.

  strip()
    The strip() member function searches the Tidy object for all
    mixed-content (ie. non-data) text nodes && empties them out. This will
    basically unformat any markup indenting. strip() is used by compress()
    && tidy() but it is exposed because it could be worthwhile by itself.

  tidy()
    The tidy() member function can take a single optional parameter as the
    string that should be inserted for each indent level. Some examples:

      # Tidy up indenting with default two  (2) spaces per indent level
         $tidy_obj->tidy();

      # Tidy up indenting with         four (4) spaces per indent level
         $tidy_obj->tidy('    ');

      # Tidy up indenting with         one  (1) tab    per indent level
         $tidy_obj->tidy("\t");

    The default behavior is to use two (2) spaces for each indent level. The
    Tidy object gets all mixed-content (ie. non-data) text nodes reformatted
    to appropriate indent levels according to tree nesting depth.

    NOTE: tidy() disturbs some XML escapes in whatever ways XML::XPath does.
    It has been brought to my attention that these modules also strip CDATA
    tags from XML files / data they operate on. Even though CDATA tags don't
    seem very common, I wish they could work all right too. Hopefully the
    vast majority of files will work fine && support for other types can be
    added later.

  compress()
    The compress() member function calls strip() on the Tidy object then
    creates an encoded comment which contains the names of elements &&
    attributes as they occurred in the original document. Their respective
    element && attribute names are replaced with just the appropriate index
    throughout the document.

    compress() can accept a parameter describing which node types to attempt
    to shrink down as abbreviations. This parameter should be a string of
    just the first letters of each node type you wish to include as in the
    following mapping:

      e = elements
      a = attribute keys
      v = attribute values *EXPERIMENTAL*
      t = text      nodes  *EXPERIMENTAL*
      c = comment   nodes  *EXPERIMENTAL*
      n = namespace nodes  *not-yet-implemented*

    Attribute values ('v') && text nodes ('t') both seem to work fine with
    current tokenization. I've still labeled them EXPERIMENTAL because they
    seem more likely to cause problems than valid element or attribute key
    names. I have some bugs in the comment node compression which I haven't
    been able to find yet so that one should be avoided for now. Since these
    three node types ('vtc') all require tokenization, they are not included
    in default compression ('ea'). An example call which includes values &&
    text would be:

      $tidy_obj->compress('eatv');

    The original document structure (ie. node hierarchy) is preserved.
    compress() significantly reduces the file size of most XML documents for
    when size matters more than immediate human readability. expand()
    performs the opposite conversion.

  expand()
    The expand() member function reads any XML::Tidy::compress comments from
    the Tidy object && uses them to reconstruct the document that was passed
    to compress().

  bcompress('BinaryOutputFilename.xtb')
    The bcompress() member function stores a binary representation of any
    Tidy object. The format consists of:

      0) a null-terminated version string
      1) a byte specifying how many bytes later indices will be
      2) the number of bytes from 1 above to designate the total string  count
      3) the number of null-terminated strings          from 2 above
      4) the number of bytes from 1 above to designate the total integer count
      5) the number of 4-byte integers                  from 4 above
      6) the number of bytes from 1 above to designate the total float   count
      7) the number of 8-byte (double-precision) floats from 6 above
      8) node index sets until the end of the file

    Normal node index sets consist of two values. The first is an index
    (again the number of bytes long comes from 1) into the three lists as if
    they were all linear. The second is a single-byte integer identifying
    the node type (using standard DOM node type enumerations).

    A few special cases exist in node index sets though. If the index is
    null, it is interpreted as a close-element tag (so no accompanying type
    value is read). On the other end, when the index is non-zero, the type
    value is always read. In the event that the type corresponds to an
    attribute or a processing instruction, the next index is read (without
    another accompanying type value) in order to complete the data fields
    required by those node types.

    NOTE: Please bear in mind that the encoding of binary integers && floats
    only works properly if the values are not surrounded by spaces or other
    delimiters && each is contained in its own single node. This is
    necessary to enable thorough reconstruction of whitespace from the
    original document. Additionally, floats without any fractional part
    (e.g. "1.0") will be encoded as an integer to save space so the decimal
    point && empty fractional part will not be reconstructed for those
    values since they are blatantly extraneous data. Please notify me if you
    desire an option to preserve these or can think of a good reason why I
    should not implement it this way. I recommend storing every numerical
    value as an isolated attribute value or text node without any
    surrounding whitespace.

      # Examples which encode all numbers as binary:
      <friend name="goodguy" category="15">
        <hitpoints>31.255</hitpoints>
        <location>
          <x>-15.65535</x>
          <y>16383.7</y>
          <z>-1023.63</z>
        </location>
      </friend>

      # Examples which encode all numbers as strings:
      <enemy name="badguy" category=" 666 ">
        <hitpoints> 2.0 </hitpoints>
        <location> 4.0 -2.0 4.0 </location>
      </enemy>

    The default file extension is .xtb (for XML::Tidy binary).

  bexpand('BinaryInputFilename.xtb')
    The bexpand() member function reads a binary file which was previously
    written from bcompress(). bexpand() is an XML::Tidy object constructor
    like new() so it can be called like:

      my $xtbo = XML::Tidy->bexpand('BinaryInputFilename.xtb');

  prune()
    The prune() member function takes an XPath location to remove (along
    with all attributes && child nodes) from the Tidy object. For example,
    to remove all comments:

      $tidy_obj->prune('//comment()');

    or to remove the third baz (XPath indexing is 1-based):

      $tidy_obj->prune('/foo/bar/baz[3]');

    Pruning your XML tree is a form of tidying too so it snuck in here. =)

  write()
    The write() member function can take an optional filename parameter to
    write out any changes to the Tidy object. If no parameters are given,
    write() overwrites the original XML document file (if a 'filename'
    parameter was given to the constructor).

    write() will croak() if no filename can be found to write to.

    write() can also take a secondary parameter which specifies an XPath
    location to be written out as the new root element instead of the Tidy
    object's root. Only the first matching element is written.

  toString()
    The toString() member function is almost identical to write() except
    that it takes no parameters && simply returns the equivalent XML string
    as a scalar. It is a little weird because normally only XML::XPath::Node
    objects have a toString() member but I figure it makes sense to extend
    the same syntax to the parent object as well since it is a useful
    option.

createNode Wrappers
    The following are just aliases to Node constructors. They'll work with
    just the unique portion of the node type as the member function name.

  e() or el() or elem() or createElement()
    wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Element->new()

  a() or at() or attr() or createAttribute()
    wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Attribute->new()

  c() or cm() or cmnt() or createComment()
    wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Comment->new()

  t() or tx() or text() or createTextNode()
    wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Text->new()

  p() or pi() or proc() or createProcessingInstruction()
    wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::PI->new()

  n() or ns() or nspc() or createNamespace()
    wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Namespace->new()

EXPORTED CONSTANTS
    XML::Tidy also exports the same node constants as XML::XPath::Node
    (which correspond to DOM values). These include:

  UNKNOWN_NODE
=head2 ELEMENT_NODE
=head2 ATTRIBUTE_NODE
=head2 TEXT_NODE
=head2 CDATA_SECTION_NODE
=head2 ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE
=head2 ENTITY_NODE
=head2 PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE
=head2 COMMENT_NODE
=head2 DOCUMENT_NODE
=head2 DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE
=head2 DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE
=head2 NOTATION_NODE
=head2 ELEMENT_DECL_NODE
=head2 ATT_DEF_NODE
=head2 XML_DECL_NODE
=head2 ATTLIST_DECL_NODE
=head2 NAMESPACE_NODE
    XML::Tidy also exports:

  STANDARD_XML_DECL
    which returns a reasonable default XML declaration string.
