   to tidy XML documents as parsed XML::XPath objects.

NAME

XML::Tidy - tidy indenting of XML documents

VERSION

This documentation refers to version 1.2.51HM2ae of 
XML::Tidy, which was released on Mon Jan 17 22:02:36:40 2005.

SYNOPSIS

  use XML::Tidy;

  # create new   XML::Tidy object from         MainFile.xml
  my $tidy_obj = XML::Tidy->new('filename' => 'MainFile.xml');

  # Tidy up the indenting
     $tidy_obj->tidy();

  # Write out changes back to MainFile.xml
     $tidy_obj->write();

DESCRIPTION

This module creates XML document objects (with inheritance from
L<XML::XPath>) to tidy mixed-content (ie. non-data) text node
indenting.

2DO

- add tests for XML::XPath::Node wrappers

- add tests for toString

- fix compress() comment bug

- add tests for compress() && expand()

- imp namespace option in compress()

- mk tidy keep doc order when duping attz, namespaces,
          (hopefully someday PIs) into temp $docu && $tnod

- fix reload() from messing up unicode escaped &XYZ; components like
          Copyright &#xA9; -> © && Registered &#xAE; -> ®

-     What else does Tidy need?

USAGE

new()

This is the standard Tidy object constructor.  It can take
the same parameters as an L<XML::XPath> object constructor to
initialize the XML document object.  These can be any one of:

  'filename' => 'SomeFile.xml'
  'xml'      => $variable_which_holds_a_bunch_of_XML_data
  'ioref'    => $file_InputOutput_reference
  'context'  => $existing_node_at_specified_context_to_become_new_obj

reload()

The reload() member function causes the latest data contained in
a Tidy object to be re-parsed which re-indexes all nodes.
This can be necessary after modifications have been made to nodes
which impact the tree node hierarchy because L<XML::XPath>'s find()
member preserves state info which can get out-of-sync.  reload() is
probably rarely useful by itself but it is needed by strip() &&
prune() so it is exposed as a method in case it comes in handy for
other uses.

strip()

The strip() member function searches the Tidy object for all
mixed-content (ie. non-data) text nodes && empties them out.
This will basically unformat any markup indenting.  strip() is
used by compress() && tidy() but it is exposed because it could be
worthwhile by itself.

tidy()

The tidy() member function can take a single optional parameter as
the string that should be inserted for each indent level.  Some
examples:

  # Tidy up indenting with default two  (2) spaces per indent level
     $tidy_obj->tidy();

  # Tidy up indenting with         four (4) spaces per indent level
     $tidy_obj->tidy('    ');

  # Tidy up indenting with         one  (1) tab    per indent level
     $tidy_obj->tidy("\t");

The default behavior is to use two (2) spaces (ie. '  ') for each
indent level.  The Tidy object gets all mixed-content (ie. non-data)
text nodes reformatted to appropriate indent levels according to tree
nesting depth.

NOTE: There seems to be a bug in L<XML::XPath> which does not allow
finding XML processing instructions (PIs) properly so they have been
commented out of tidy().  This means that tidy() unfortunately
removes processing instructions from files it operates on.  I hope
this shortcoming can be repaired in the near future.  tidy() also
disturbs some XML escapes in whatever ways L<XML::XPath> does.

compress()

The compress() member function calls strip() on the Tidy object
then creates comments ahead of the root element which contain the
names of elements && attributes as they occurred with their
respective element && attribute names represented as just an index
throughout the document.

compress() can accept a parameter describing which node types to
attempt to shrink down as abbreviations.  This parameter should be
a string of just the first letters of each node type you wish to
include as in the following mapping:

  e = elements
  a = attribute keys
  v = attribute values *EXPERIMENTAL*
  t = text      nodes  *EXPERIMENTAL*
  c = comment   nodes  *EXPERIMENTAL*
  n = namespace nodes  *not-yet-implemented*

Attribute values ('v') && text nodes ('t') both seem to work fine as
they are tokenized.  I have some bugs in the comment node compression
which I haven't been able to find yet so that one should be avoided
for now.  Since these three node types ('vtc') all require tokenization,
they are not included in default compression ('ea').  An example call
which includes values && text would be:

  $tidy_obj->compress('eatv');

The original document structure (ie. node hierarchy) is preserved.
compress() significantly reduces the file size of most XML documents
for when size matters more than immediate human readability.
expand() performs the opposite conversion.

expand()

The expand() member function reads any XML::Tidy::compress comments
from the Tidy object && uses them to reconstruct the document
that was passed to compress().  These utilities together seem like
a mildly useful way to tidy XML documents so they earned inclusion
in this module.  compress() && expand() should be considered
experimental.

prune()

The prune() member function takes an XPath location to remove (along
with all attributes && child nodes) from the Tidy object.  For
example, to remove all comments:

  $tidy_obj->prune('//comment()');

or to remove the third baz (XPath indexing is 1-based):

  $tidy_obj->prune('/foo/bar/baz[3]');

Pruning your XML tree is a form of tidying too so it snuck in here. =)
It seems L<XML::XPath> objects are dramatically more useful when they
all have access to this class of additional member functions.

write()

The write() member function can take an optional filename parameter
to write out any changes to the Tidy object.  If no parameters
are given, write() overwrites the original XML document file (if
a 'filename' parameter was given to the constructor).

write() will croak() if no filename can be found to write to.

write() can also take a secondary parameter which specifies an XPath
location to be written out as the new root element instead of the
Tidy object's root.  Only the first matching element is written.

toString()

The toString() member function is almost identical to write() except
that it takes no parameters && simply returns the equivalent XML
string as a scalar.  It is a little weird because normally only
XML::XPath::Node objects have a toString member but I figure it makes
sense to extend the same syntax to the parent object as well since
it is a useful option.

createNode Wrappers

The following are just aliases to Node constructors.  They'll work with
just the unique portion of the node type as the member function name.

e() or el() or elem() or createElement()

wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Element->new()

a() or at() or attr() or createAttribute()

wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Attribute->new()

c() or cm() or cmnt() or createComment()

wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Comment->new()

t() or tx() or text() or createTextNode()

wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Text->new()

p() or pi() or proc() or createProcessingInstruction()

wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::PI->new()

n() or ns() or nspc() or createNamespace()

wrapper for XML::XPath::Node::Namespace->new()

EXPORTED CONSTANTS

XML::Tidy also exports the same node constants as L<XML::XPath::Node>
(which correspond to DOM values).  These include:

  UNKNOWN_NODE
  ELEMENT_NODE
  ATTRIBUTE_NODE
  TEXT_NODE
  CDATA_SECTION_NODE
  ENTITY_REFERENCE_NODE
  ENTITY_NODE
  PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE
  COMMENT_NODE
  DOCUMENT_NODE
  DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE
  DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_NODE
  NOTATION_NODE
  ELEMENT_DECL_NODE
  ATT_DEF_NODE
  XML_DECL_NODE
  ATTLIST_DECL_NODE
  NAMESPACE_NODE

XML::Tidy also exports:

  STANDARD_XML_DECL

which returns a reasonable default XML declaration string.
